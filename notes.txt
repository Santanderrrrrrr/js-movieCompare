When developing an application, a good way to go about it is
  by first:
    setting up application boilerplate
    identifying challenging aspects of the project about to be undertaken
    get started on project and writing the code
 

Debouncing
    say you only have a limited amount of api calls you can make
    to keep the user from using up all api calls when simply typing the search term:
        make it such that the user can type and retype all that he wishes
        but the search is only done when the user lets his fingers off the keyboard
    This is implemented by:
        initializing a function variable but not declaring it
        assigning the function variable a timeout function that will
          run the api call only after the user hasnt typed a thing into the
          keyboard after the set time
          What keeps the timeout from running is that there's a clearTimeout 
            function running with every input listen, clearing the previously 
            engaged timeout
          The timeout runs if the user does not type, thus clearing it.

        The above process is known as "debouncing"
